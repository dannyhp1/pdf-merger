#### PDF Merger
A straight forward application that allows you to merge different PDF files together. 

Files are merged client-side. Nothing is stored on the server.

#### Development
Clone the project, and change your directory into the project.
- Run `yarn` to resolve and fetch packages.
- Run `yarn start` to run the frontend. Locally it can be found at localhost:8000.
